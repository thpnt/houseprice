# House Price Prediction Project

This project is based on the Kaggle competition "House Price Prediction," where I applied various data science techniques to predict house prices using a public dataset. The main objectives of this project include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and applying advanced regression techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

## Competition Summary

- **Objective**: Predict house prices.
- **Scoring Metric**: Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSE).
- **Best Score Achieved (yet)**: 0.17 RMSLE.

## Project Overview

In this project, I aimed to showcase my understanding of data science projects and some of the underlying mathematics behind them. The Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository contains detailed steps and explanations of the following key aspects:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: I explored the dataset to understand its structure, identify patterns, and visualize important features.

2. **Feature Engineering**: I engineered new features and transformed existing ones to improve the predictive power of the models.

3. **Regression Techniques**: I implemented advanced regression techniques to create models that accurately predict house prices.

4. **Scikit-Learn Workflow**: Throughout the project, I followed the full pipeline workflow/framework of scikit-learn, incorporating data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation strategies. This approach ensures a systematic and efficient process for building and evaluating machine learning models.


## Future Improvements

While I achieved a decent RMSE score of 0.17, I intend to revisit this notebook in the future to explore further improvements. My commitment to learning and refining my data science skills will drive me to enhance this project and aim for an even better score.

## About Me

I completed this project in my free time, driven by my passion for data science and a desire to explore new regression techniques. It allowed me to sharpen my data science-related skills and gain valuable experience in tackling real-world data challenges.

Feel free to explore the notebook, ask questions, or provide feedback. I appreciate your interest in my work, and I'm excited to continue my journey in the world of data science!
